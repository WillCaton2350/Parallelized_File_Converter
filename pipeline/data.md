Step 1.
# Extract the csv data from a multiline string.

Step 2.
# Transform that csv data into json using a pandas dataframe in the current directory.

# (The Transformation process is parallelized)

Step 3.
# Loading the parallelized json data to the current directory

Step 4.
# Map the ETL process to a number of threads to achieve parallel-ism at runtime.
 
Step 5.
# Instantiate the ETL process and execute the program.
